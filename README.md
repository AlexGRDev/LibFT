## üß© Description

**Libft** is a custom C library that reimplements the most commonly used functions of the standard C library (`libc`) and provides additional utilities written from scratch.  
The goal is to understand deeply how low-level memory manipulation, string handling, linked lists, and file descriptor operations work internally.
